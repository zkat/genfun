   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 11:34]
   Make sure there's some way to get the global Genfun object?

   Make sure the system can be loaded/built on commonjs

   Make genfun.js work whether you're using a raw import, amd, or commonjs
   UPDATE: awesome, browserify already does this for you. :)
** DONE Make __roles__ even more obscure                            :feature:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 13:18]
   It could still conflict with other internals, unfortunately.
** DONE Split genfun.js into multiple files                        :yakshave:

** DONE Implement Genfun.no_applicable_method                       :feature:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 14:27]
   See http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/f_no_app.htm
** DONE genfun.js-style external API                                    :api:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 15:15]
   Change the API so things work more like how genfun.js likes things to be
   defined (with genfuns being treated more like functions inside modules)
** DONE camelCase for external interface                               :misc:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 15:18]
   Everything that's external should use camelCase like regular javascript.
** DONE Write docs                                                     :docs:

   Sphinx looks nice. Maybe I'll try that this time around.
   UPDATE: used jsdoc
** DONE Fix stack overflow when [[[[Proto]]]] is null                       :bug:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-17 Sat 21:30]
   See test failure. It probably has to do with how noApplicableMethod will
   try to dispatch on all arguments, treating things like Object.prototype.
** DONE Make tests runnable in testling                                :test:

* backlog [0/9]
** TODO Use partial dispatch trick                             :optimization:
** TODO Cache effective method function                        :optimization:
   Can probably be done as part of the PIC?
** TODO IE7/IE8 support                                              :compat:
   Array methods, possibly defineProperty usage. Other things, too?
** TODO Write benchmark test                                           :test:
   Write benchmark tests that fail when certain things get too slow. Or,
   start by searching around for what sort of things people do when they
   want to test performance from a library.
** TODO Can I trick browsers into giving me Map information?   :optimization:
** TODO Change function/var naming to camelCase                        :misc:
   Ugh. Maybe some day.
** TODO Put together a bug for the Object.prototype thing              :misc:
** TODO Inherit from Function if allowed                            :feature:
** TODO Special-case genfun functions in dispatch                   :feature:
   If we try to dispatch a genfun's wrapper function, redirect dispatch so
   that it pretends it's actually working on the genfun.

** DONE Release on npm                                              :release:
   CLOSED: [2013-08-18 Sun 00:28]
** TODO Consistent term for a method's 'participants'            :yakshaving:
** TODO More fine-grained dispatch tests                               :test:
   Right now, dispatch testing is covered by a single big blob of
   tests. Make more granular tests that test things like integration with
   primitives, variable arity methods, empty places in the dispatch array,
   empty dispatch arrays, prototype inheritance, etc.
** TODO split test/genfun.js into multiple files                       :test:
   It's starting to be a bit of an overwhelming blob of text.
** TODO Consider using something other than assert for tests           :test:
** TODO Reconsider how dispatch works when dispatch list is []      :feature:
   The intent was for it to work like [Object.prototype], but this doesn't
   really make sense when you're dealing with objects with null
   [[[[Proto]]]]. Perhaps just get rid of the "feature" altogether? Another
   possibility is to get rid of noApplicableMethod (or hide it/discourage
   it) and have [] mean "default".
   Update: I like the latter idea, but implementation seems to break other
   things. write some more tests before diving into this one. Need full
   dispatch coverage, specially for things involving null [[[[Proto]]]]
** TODO Improve docs with a tutorial or explanation                    :docs:
   Right now, there's a quickstart and some light API docs. Figure out how
   to best explain what genfun.js does and how to use it.
** TODO multiple method definition syntax for new Genfun()          :feature:
   So you can do something like:

   var frob = new Genfun({
     methods: [{
       arguments: [Number.prototype],
       fun: function(num) {
         return "got a number!";
       }
     }]
   });
** TODO Implement a PIC                                        :optimization:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching#Polymorphic_inline_caching
   How the hell can you do that with JS without a preprocessor?
** TODO make release target                                         :release:
   Add make release to the Makefile. Should do a test, git tag, and push
   out to npm.
** TODO Method combination                                          :feature:
   Or at least the ability to Genfun.next_method()
** TODO Method redefinition                                         :feature:
   Overwrite methods with identical specs.
** TODO Method removal                                              :feature:
   Write a removeMethod() method.
** TODO Score according to arglist position                         :feature:
   Right now, all arguments across the arglist are scored evenly. Consider
   making items earlier in the arglist have greater weight in the scoring
   algorithm.
