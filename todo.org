** TODO IE7/IE8 support                                              :compat:
   May only need to shim array methods.

** TODO Write a package.json file                                  :yakshave:
** TODO Use mocha for tests                                        :yakshave:
** TODO Add build system                                           :yakshave:
** TODO Method combination                                          :feature:
   Or at least the ability to Genfun.next_method()
** TODO Method redefinition                                         :feature:
   Overwrite methods with identical specs.
** TODO Method removal                                              :feature:
   Write a removeMethod() method.
** TODO CommonJS support                                            :feature:
   Make sure the system can be loaded/built on commonjs
** TODO Change function/var naming to camelCase                        :misc:
** TODO Put together a bug for the Object.prototype thing              :misc:
** TODO Implement a PIC                                        :optimization:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching#Polymorphic_inline_caching
   How the hell can you do that with JS without a preprocessor?
** TODO Use partial dispatch trick                             :optimization:
** TODO Cache effective method function                        :optimization:
   Can probably be done as part of the PIC?
** TODO Split genfun.js into multiple files                        :yakshave:
** TODO Score according to arglist position                         :feature:
   Right now, all arguments across the arglist are scored evenly. Consider
   making items earlier in the arglist have greater weight in the scoring
   algorithm.
** TODO Metacircular genfun.js                                         :misc:
   Make genfun.js work off its own style of OO.
   Probably wait until the damn thing is more stable.
